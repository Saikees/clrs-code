This document and project is work in progress. Adding the minimal necessary 
information for now.

* What is this project is all about?

This repository contains the programs I had written while studying
"Introduction to Algorithms" - 2nd edition. 

The repository name 'clrs-code' refers to the last names of the authors of
the book:

1. Thomas H. Cormen
2. Charles E. Leiserson
3. Ronal L. Rivest
4. Clifford Stein

* Why did I do this?

The main motivation behind this project was to aggregate and provide
ready-to-run example environment as a whole and not just standalone programs.
The most important driving factor was the ability to add a --debug option
to most of the programs and see them in action (e.g. sorting, searching, etc.).
This part coupled with nose based testing make it easier to understand
and verify changes to the programs.

This project is dedicated to the authors of the book and the numerous people
who have given their time to create study material for the subject of 
Algorithms and Data structures.
